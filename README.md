# HRNET


## To start the project do the following steps:


### Run `npm install`

The project will take a certain amount of time to install due to extra dependencies getting
added unnecessarily.It is a problem I didn't fix because I was running out of time.

### Run `npm start`

Everything should be working fine !
In case there is a problem,see the note down below.


**Note: if for some reason `react-scripts` module is missing run the command `npm i react-scripts` before running the command `npm start`**
